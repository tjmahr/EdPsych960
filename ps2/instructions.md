## Problem Set 2: Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis

School principals can shape teachers’ professional development, define the
school’s educational goals, ensure that instructional practice is directed
towards achieving these goals, suggest modifications to improve teaching
practices, and help solve problems that may arise within the classroom or among
teachers. Principals are not only administrators, they can also become
instructional leaders who motivate teachers to improve the quality of their
practice and provide a framework for effective teacher collaboration.

An international comparative study shows that effective principals are likely to
display both administrate and instructional leadership (OECD, 2009). PISA 2012
asked school principals to report how frequently various actions and behaviors
related to managing their school, including teacher participation in school
management, occurred in the previous academic year.

For this assignment, please conduct the following set of analyses:

1. Read in the data and code the 999 as NA and omit the missing data.
2. Conduct an exploratory factor analysis using principle axis factoring and
   promax rotation looking 1, 2, 3, and 4 factors.
3. Conduct the same factor analysis using ML and report fit statistics and the BIC.
4. Based on your decision regarding the number of factors, conduct a CFA and
   report the results (fit, factor loadings, etc.)
5. Inspect the modification indices from the CFA for cross-loadings, if any.
   Provide and explanation based on the wording of the item as to why there may be
   a cross-loading.
6. Re-estimate the model with the cross-loading added.
7. Write-up the findings in a manner consistent with the publication style in your field.
